/**
 * Interface for the destination's consumption of incoming records wrapped in an
 * {@link io.airbyte.protocol.models.AirbyteMessage}.
 *
 * This is via the accept method, which commonly handles parsing, validation, batching and writing
 * of the transformed data to the final destination i.e. the technical system data is being written
 * to.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 * <li>1. Instantiate consumer.</li>
 * <li>2. start() to initialize any resources that need to be created BEFORE the consumer consumes
 * any messages.</li>
 * <li>3. Consumes ALL records via {@link DestinationConsumer#accept(T)}</li>
 * <li>4. Always (on success or failure) finalize by calling
 * {@link DestinationConsumer#close()}</li>
 *
 * We encourage implementing this interface using the {@link FailureTrackingConsumer} class.
